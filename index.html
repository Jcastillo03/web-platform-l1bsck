<h1><b>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)</b></h1>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p> <b> Ada Lovelace </b> was born in London on December 10, 1815. Her mother was Anne Isabella Milbanke and her father was the famous poet George Gordon Byron.  Her parents separated when she was very young and her mother, who retained custody, actively encouraged her education in mathematics in the hope that Ada would turn out very different from her poet father.</p>

<p>Ada indeed showed talent for mathematics and for language.  As a teen, she became friends with the mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage, and through him was able to begin studying advanced mathematics with a University of London professor. Ada married in 1835 and bore three children. She died of cancer on November 27, 1852. </p>

<h3>Contributions to Computer Science</h3>

<p><b>Ada Lovelace's</b> contributions to computer science began in the context of her friendship with Charles Babbage.  She saw his notes and his prototype for his "difference engine" and heard his ideas about creating an "analytical engine."</p>

<p>When asked to translate an article about the analytical engine, Ada performed the translation and added in her own original ideas. Unlike Babbage, who had only envisioned the machine for performing calculations, Ada foresaw and described the power of the machine as a device that could follow an algorithm.  Ada included in her notes what many consider to be the first computer program, nearly 100 years before the first programmable computer was ever built.</p>
